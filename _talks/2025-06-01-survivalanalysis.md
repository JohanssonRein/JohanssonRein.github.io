**Overview** This is a series of conference focusing on survival analysis organised by me during Summer 2025. In this talk, we will learn the basic of survival analysis. The talk contains the elementry properties of cohort survival data: Censoring and Truncations. Then we will try to estimate and test different survival features based on parametric, non-parametric and semi-parametric inference. In parametric inference, standard likelihood methods and testing methods may be used with modification of censored data; In non-parametric inference, we shall introduce Kaplan-Meier, Nelson-Aalen and Aalen-Johansen (non-parametric) estimators, and non-parametric testing techniques including log-rank test; In semi-parametric inference, we shall introduce Cox's proportional hazard model, and different regression techniques for the survival data. A rigorous approach to some asymptotic properties via counting process may be introduced as well.
