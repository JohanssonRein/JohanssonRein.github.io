During my undergraduate, I have been working as a mathematics tutor as well as TA for several courses. I offer one-to-one lectures to students in need, also give tutorials to the whole class several times. Beside that, I am also running my own video channel on Bilibili, a Chinese online video platform 
just like YouTube. My lectures on Bilibili platform mainly foucs on math subject in Gaokao (Chinese College Enterance Examination), where I lectured on different topics (in Chinese) and had 6K subscribers so far. You can visit my Bilibili personal page here:
