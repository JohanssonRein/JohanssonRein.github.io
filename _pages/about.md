* My name is Jiajun Zhang, you may call me Johnson. I am from Luoyang, China.

# Course Work and Studies

* I am currently an undergraduate student at McGill University, located in Montréal, Canada. My major is Honors Applied Mathematics with a concentration in statistics.

* I was in Honors Statistics and Computer Science for the first two years of my study, and I transferred to Honors Applied Mathematics on my third year to further develop a solid training in mathematics. My undergraduate mathematics course works include:

  * 4 semesters of calculus (Single Variable Differential Calculus; Single Variable Integral Calculus; Multi-Variable Calculus and Advanced Calculus)
  * 4 semesters of real analysis (Single Variable Real Analysis I, II; Measure Theory and Lebesgue Integration theory; Functional analysis)
  * 2 semesters of linear algebra
  * 2 semesters of abstract algebra
  * 3 semesters of probability theory and statistics
  * A list of statistics oriented courses: Regression and ANOVA; Sampling Theory; Deep Learning and Neural Networks
  * Also a list of computer science oriented courses include programming in python, Java, OCaml; Algorithms and Data Structures

# Research Interests

* My research interests so far are in mathematical statistics and partial differential equations. Furthermore I am also interested in one field where mathematics is widely applied:  Biostatistics, especially the field of survival analysis, I would like to study survival analysis alongside with causal inference, also investigating some multi-state models using markov chain and probability theory.

* I am currently doing my research in survival analysis with professor Masoud Asgharian in McGill University, Department of Mathematics and Statistics. You may find my research thesis here: [Analysing Incident and Prevalent Cohort Survival Data (2025)](/files/survivalanalysis.pdf),
which is still under construction. It provides a theoretical approach and serves as an introduction to
survival analysis, where basic concepts including censoring and truncation were introduced, also examined different estimating techniques for parametric; non-parametric and semi-parametric as well as hypothesis testing.
