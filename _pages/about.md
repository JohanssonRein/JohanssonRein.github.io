* My name is Jiajun Zhang, you may call me Johnson. I am from Luoyang, China.

# Research Interests

* My research interests so far are in mathematical statistics. Furthermore I am also interested in one field where mathematics is widely applied:  Biostatistics, especially the field of survival analysis, I would like to study survival analysis alongside with causal inference, also investigating some multi-state models using markov chain and probability theory.

* I am currently doing my research in survival analysis with professor Masoud Asgharian in McGill University, Department of Mathematics and Statistics. You may find my research thesis here: [Analysing Incident and Prevalent Cohort Survival Data (2025)](/files/survivalanalysis.pdf),
which is still under construction. It provides a theoretical approach and serves as an introduction to
survival analysis, where basic concepts including censoring and truncation were introduced, I also examined different estimating techniques for parametric; non-parametric and semi-parametric inference as well as hypothesis testing. Some further topics like Bayesian approach to survival analysis;
survival analysis with causal inference, etc. may be my further research topics.
