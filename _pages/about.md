My name is Jiajun Zhang, you may call me Johansson. I am currently a undergraduate student at McGill University, located in Montreal, Canada. My major is Honors Applied Mathematics, and my research interests so far are in mathematical statistics and partial differential equations. Furthermore I am also interested in two fields where mathematics is widely applied: Mathmetical Fiance and Biostatistics. I finished my undergraduate research and wrote my first thesis in survival analysis. Before coming to Canada, I lived in Luoyang, China, a city known for its historical heritages. It was the captical city for 13 different dynasties throughout the history of China.
