My name is Jiajun Zhang, I am an undergraduate at McGill University, located in Montreal Canada. My major is Honors Applied Mathematics, and my research interests are in mathematical statistics and partial differential equations. Before coming to Canada, I was in Luoyang, China most of the time.

I love travelling, cooking, and plane-spotting. Below is a collection of some of my favourite pictures taken throughout my undergraduate period:
