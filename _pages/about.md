* My name is Jiajun Zhang, you may call me Johnson. I am currently an undergraduate student at McGill University, located in Montreal, Canada. My major is Honors Applied Mathematics, and my research interests so far are in mathematical statistics and partial differential equations. Furthermore I am also interested in one field where mathematics is widely applied:  Biostatistics, especially the field of survival analysis, I would like to study survival analysis alongside with causal inference, also investigating some multi-state models using markov chain and probability theory.

* I finished my undergraduate research and wrote my first thesis in survival analysis. Before coming to Canada, I lived in Luoyang, China, a city known for its historical heritages. It was the captical city for 13 different dynasties throughout the history of China.
